# Bank Customer Churn Analysis Using Decision Trees

## Overview
This R-based project implements decision tree analysis to predict customer churn in banking. The model analyses historical customer data to identify patterns that indicate likelihood of customer departure, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning
- Detailed exploratory data analysis with visualisations
- Implementation of decision tree classification
- K-fold cross-validation for model validation
- Partial dependence plots for feature analysis
- Confusion matrix for model evaluation

## Model Performance Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Cross-validation results

## Usage
1. Ensure all required packages are installed
2. Load the dataset
3. Run the preprocessing steps
4. Train the model
5. Evaluate results
6. Generate visualisations
